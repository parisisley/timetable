In Lab 1, we were asked to create a calendar using HTML, CSS, React, and Javascript. I have some previous experience in web development, so this lab was familiar and fun. 
I enjoyed making a fake calendar, as my real calendar looks more daunting. 
I learned about React, and this was my first introduction to Github. The real challenge for me was learning how to use github and VS code together. Below are the required features for lab 1

A one-week calendar that includes one-hour time blocks
Events have different titles
Events have different colors based on their type

I completed all three requirements. 


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
